To run this program, first make it by typing 'make'.
Then type ./fly followed by the name of the input file containing the list of flights (including any extension).
The program will then ask for user input for the name of the departure city (Case sensative), 
followed by another prompt for the arrival city.

Then you will be asked for the earliest time at which you are willing to depart
You will then be asked for the itinerary method you want to use ("any", "earliest", or "cheapest")

After the first itinerary you will be asked for the earliest time at which you are willing to depart one more time.

Then the program will terminate, and to run it again you must start from the beginning




in.txt seems to work for my program and testinp.txt seems to work correctly for cost as well as test.

Thanks for your help TA's/Lewis,
I hope you having nice finals.
